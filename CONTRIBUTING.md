# Contributions

We appreciate contributions of any kind, however to keep this clean, this is what we want:

When creating a pull request, please explain all changes clearly. Please check for duplicates before starting a
pull request (sorry).

Your code will be ran through 2 Continuous Integration providers: Jenkins and Travis. If one of these fail, we will 
require that you edit your code and make sure both builds pass.

Thank you for help keeping TowerWarZ high quality.
