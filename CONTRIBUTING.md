# Contributions

We appreciate contributions of any kind, however to keep this clean, this is what we want:

1. No other languages except
  - Java 
  - Objective-C (iOS app)
2. Do not delete files without putting a text file with the name of the file you deleted and the reason you deleted it.
3. We need people to do the graphics! We have a reason for making it Open-source! Please, we need contributers! Thanks!
4. Use an IDE. We don't like nasty build failures, this hampers our debugging.
