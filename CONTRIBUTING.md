# Contributions

We appreciate contributions of any kind, however, like always, some guidelines are here to ensure we don't create a second Java.

When creating a pull request, please explain all changes clearly. Please check for duplicates before starting a
pull request (sorry).

Your code should be able to pass Continuous Integration tests. You can check the status of the tests on the pull request
 page itself.

Any code you provide must be licensed under the MIT license. For simple, easy-to-understand terms, view [this](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

Thank you for your contributions! :D
