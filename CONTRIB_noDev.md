# You're not a programmer?

You **still** can contribute!

At this point in time, we are short of graphics, animations and sounds.
Of course, we can't make this a successful project with just our programming, right?

This is why, we need **you**!

If you feel that you have some great graphics, tasteful animations or melodious sounds
to offer us, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/xiurobert/TowerWarZ/issues) with the title as:
`<Graphic/Anim/Sound>: [name of graphic/animation/sound]`

Example: `<Sound>: foo.bar`
