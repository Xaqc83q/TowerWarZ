# You're not a programmer?

It doesn't matter!

At this point in time, we lack graphics, animations and sounds.
You know, its a new millenium, and eh... In this new millenium, we don't use primitive things like letters for graphics!

That's why we need **you**!

If you feel that you have some great graphics, tasteful animations or melodious sounds
to offer us, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/xiurobert/TowerWarZ/issues) with the title as:
`<Graphic/Anim/Sound>: [name of graphic/animation/sound]`

Example: `<Sound>: foo.bar`
