# Why is this repo empty?

Hello Guys!

This repo is kind of empty right now -- Don't worry, we didn't abandon the project! We should soon be filling
this beautiful repo up
and our project would be up and running


## So exactly what's up?

I'm sure you want to know! Well, here is a quote from the creators

> We are currently busy at other projects, just stay put!
We are currently working on other projects, such as [FloodGATE IRC Bot](https://github.com/xiurobert/FloodGATE). Please bear 
with us for a while and this repo will start filling up

If in the meantime, you get bored of waiting, why not play [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net)? We love that game, its written in 
Java
